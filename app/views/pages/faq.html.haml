      %p.question#1 
        =link_to 'Can I use Pinball Map data on my own site?', '#1', :class => "no_underline"
      %p.answer
        You can use our public API to fetch data and use it for your app. When using Pinball Map data, 
        %span.bold according to our data license you must include attribution and a link back to this site. 
        If you need bulk data for a project, please get in touch. We have collaborated with many folks on their projects, from student projects to services by major pinball companies. Please do not just scrape large amounts of this site for your own arcade/pinball mapping site, with no attribution. Thousands of people have been contributing their time and effort to this site since 2008.

        =link_to 'Location name has changed - how do I change it?', '#15', :class => "no_underline"
      %p.answer
        Only administrators can change the name of a location. Just contact us and we'll change it!

        =link_to 'This machine is no longer at this location.', '#2', :class => "no_underline"
      %p.answer
        This is a user-powered map, and YOU can remove the machine from the location. On the website, just click the "remove" button that's below the machine name. On the app, click on the machine name, and then look for a "remove" button or trash can icon.

      %p.question#3
        =link_to 'This location closed/no longer has machines.', '#3', :class => "no_underline"
      %p.answer
        Simply remove all the machines from it. We get notified once a week about empty locations, and then we delete them (sometimes we wait longer to delete them because we want to verify that the machines are really gone). So, no need to tell us. But still, thanks for telling us and for updating the map!

      %p.question#4 
        =link_to 'This location is temporarily closed. Should I remove the machines from it?', '#4', :class => "no_underline"
      %p.answer
        No. If a place is seasonal or closed due to restrictions, and is expected to re-open, please do not remove the machines from it. Just edit the location description to say it's temporarily closed. You can also make sure the phone number is listed, so that people can easily call and check on the status.

        =link_to 'This location has moved. Should I remove the machines from it and re-submit?', '#5', :class => "no_underline"
      %p.answer
        No. Administrators can change the address. Please 
        = link_to 'let us know', about_path('portland')
        if a location has moved. It's preferable to simply change the address because that retains the location history.

      %p.question#16
        =link_to 'Can you include bat games, or other non-pinball but pinball-adjacent games?', '#16', :class => "no_underline"
      %p.answer== We fully understand that pitch and bat games resemble pinball machines and the collectors that collect them also usually collect pinball machines. The short answer is, no, no bat games. In general we use #{link_to 'OPDB.org', 'https://opdb.org', :target => "_blank"} as a guide for what machines to include. The overall goal of this site is to map pinball, and though we understand that you may passionately think bat games should also be included because etc etc, please note that in our polling of the general public basically no one else wants bat games on the map. At any rate, thank you for that question and your feedback, and if you want more details about this decision, please #{link_to 'read this blog post', 'https://blog.pinballmap.com/2021/05/31/more-spring-cleaning/', :target => "_blank" }. Please do not send us a message about this without reading that blog post. 
      
      %p.answer The one unfortunate exception is that we include the 1991 Williams bat game, SlugFest. We only do this because when it's not on the map, users add the 1952 Williams pinball machine, Slugfest, to the map, and then comment that it's actually the bat game from 1991. Because we abhor ugly, incorrect data, we granted an exception. We are not happy with this.

      %p.answer We do include some pre-pinball flipperless games.

        Great question! As a small token of acknowledgement of your contributions to the map, if you make more than 50 contributions, we christen you a "Super Mapper". After 250 contributions, you are a "Legendary Mapper". And after 500 amazing map contributions, you are a "Grand Champ Mapper"!

      %p.answer
        No. Pinball Map only lists publicly-accessible locations. The definition of 'public' varies - some places have entrance fees, or limited hours. But overall, the location has to be inclusive and accessible. So please don't submit your house or a private club that excludes people from becoming members.

      %p.question#12 
        =link_to "I am an operator or business owner, and people are leaving comments that I don't like on my machines. Can you make them stop, or disable comments on my machines?", '#12', :class => "no_underline"
      %p.answer
        The short answer is that we will/can not disable comments at an individual venue or for an individual user. We understand that users and operators tend to want conflicting things. Some operators find reports of technical issues to be very useful; and some do not. Some operators wish that folks would only leave "general" machine comments and not "specific" comments. On the other hand, most regular users find machine comments to be a very valuable feature. It is difficult to perfectly cater to everyone, and we cannot control the comments that people make.
      %p.answer
        Comments may be removed and/or accounts can be disabled in some cases (see the next FAQ items). We will always look into your concerns. But please try not to waste our time with your requests. 
      %p.answer
        Some suggestions to operators (and regular users):
      %ul
        %li
          A comment about a machine issue is not going to hurt your business in the short term. Pinball Map often gets blamed for "making" operators rush across town to fix and issue and write a comment saying the issue is fixed.
        %li
          Users definitely notice when operators remove and re-add the same machine in order to clear out comments they don't like. It makes it seem like the operator is whitewashing comments rather than fixing issues. We strongly discourage doing this, and instead ask that operators simply write a note saying the issue is fixed! This history is actually really valuable.
        %li
          To regular users leaving comments: It is generally preferable to directly tell operators about problems. For example, in person or with a note to staff at the venue. Many pinball issues are minor and temporary, and leaving a comment about them on the map puts it "on the record" and creates a burden for the operator to then write a comment about the issue being fixed.
        %li
          We regularly get messages from operators and owners demanding that a user be banned from leaving comments on their location. Most often, the comments in question are not slanderous, but have some sass or "off-topic" messages. These requests are a big headache for us, especially because they do not warrant any action toward the user. So please, help us! Be mindful that operators are very sensitive about the content on this site, and they take it out on us.

      %p.question#13 
        =link_to 'Why was my comment removed?', '#13', :class => "no_underline"
      %p.answer
        Our moderators may deem your machine or location comment to be inappropriate because:
      %ul
        %li
          It contains a personal attack
        %li
          It isn't relevant (for example, promoting a tournament in a machine comment) or constructive
        %li
          It is offensive

        =link_to 'Why was my account disabled?', '#14', :class => "no_underline"
      %ul
        %li
          If your account has been used to mess with data on the site, then we may ban it. Bad behavior includes, but is not limited to: deleting machines that are at a location; adding machines that are not at a location; leaving lots of inappropriate/abusive comments.
        %li
          You created a sockpuppet account to hype your location and/or disparage the competition. This is unethical and it makes the site worse. Don't do this. Look in the mirror.
        %li
          You signed up with a disposable email account. We sometimes have legitimate reasons for contacting you individually. Disposable emails are most often used by people who abuse the site.
