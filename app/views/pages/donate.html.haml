        %span.red.font18.bold Since 2008,
        we've spent countless evenings and weekends building, maintaining, and enhancing Pinball Map. It's a fun project, and we're grateful that so many people find it useful. We're committed to continuing to improve the site.
      %p But as the site has grown in popularity and scope, the infrastructure costs have also grown! We need help!
      %p We've never made money off of this site, and we want it to remain ad-free. If you like Pinball Map and want to help support it, you have our heartfelt thanks!
      %p If Patreon isn't your thing, you could also make a one-time donation, via paypal.
